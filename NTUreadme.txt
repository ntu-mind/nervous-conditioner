THERE IS NOTHING SAFE ABOUT SPACE
SPACE IS A DARK POOL OF VIOLENT POTENTIAL

INFINITE IN CREATION
THIS CHARMING VACUUM THAT KEEPS OUT OF YOUR WAY ONLY TO SWALLOW THAT WHICH ISN'T

YOU CANNOT MAKE SPACE SAFE
A DARK SEA WHICH CONSUMES ALL,
IT EXISTS TO CONNECT
CONNECTS TO EXIST
INDISCRIMINATELY, UNSTABLE
A NERVOUS CONDITION
